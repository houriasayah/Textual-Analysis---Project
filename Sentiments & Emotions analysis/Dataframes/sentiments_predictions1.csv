But change is inevitable One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming.

But change is inevitable One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends",en,"([0.0037574847, 0.012673437, 0.011778708, 0.0029389288, 0.01980412, 0.0054666433, 0.003142728, 0.014906674, 0.02367488, 0.03277506, 0.05732833, 0.3526302, 0.118677996], [0.045396183, 0.16599889, 0.15636575, 0.04009415, 0.22912827, 0.053703923, 0.045575257, 0.17446412, 0.23014288, 0.30801785, 0.33650947, 0.5702739, 0.51256204], [0.9508464, 0.8213277, 0.8318555, 0.956967, 0.7510677, 0.9408294, 0.9512821, 0.8106292, 0.7461822, 0.65920717, 0.6061622, 0.07709587, 0.36875996])",0.05073501542210579,0.22063326835632324,0.7286317348480225

She said: ""I was very amused"" I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend"" Come on!

But change is inevitable One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends",en,"([0.0037574847, 0.012673437, 0.011778708, 0.0029389288, 0.01980412, 0.0054666433, 0.003142728, 0.014906674, 0.02367488, 0.03277506, 0.05732833, 0.3526302, 0.118677996], [0.045396183, 0.16599889, 0.15636575, 0.04009415, 0.22912827, 0.053703923, 0.045575257, 0.17446412, 0.23014288, 0.30801785, 0.33650947, 0.5702739, 0.51256204], [0.9508464, 0.8213277, 0.8318555, 0.956967, 0.7510677, 0.9408294, 0.9512821, 0.8106292, 0.7461822, 0.65920717, 0.6061622, 0.07709587, 0.36875996])",0.05073501542210579,0.22063326835632324,0.7286317348480225

The triggers are cold at the O.K. Corral But it ain't okay when my people live foul Another sad case of the black-on-black It's a fact, some of our people don't know how to act Can't go to the club, can't to the store Can't chill with your girl, can't go to the show Can't do anything without some fool actin' up You start to believe that black folk are savage but Before you do, allow me to say That in the old days we didn't act that way, see Kings and Queens were the names of the righteous But the sons of slaves are insane and we might just Self-destruct and erupt without a chance to grow This ain't the days of old   Damn This ain't the days of old I don't know C'mon  There is no match for a united America, a determined America, an angry America... Our outrage against the ploy unites us, brings us together behind this one plan of action, an assault on every front (Better wake up)  So I say, what will it take before we change up? Some more of us dead, or more of us locked up? Or maybe even more of us will blame the white man Before we understand now the problem's not him What I'm tellin' ya is actual fact I'm ain't pro-human 'cause all humans ain't pro-Black Remember in your mind that there still exists A plan to bring down a black fist See the struggle is uphill, life's at a standstill Jack popped Jill, now he don't act real And every livin' moment got her singin' the blues Her sole provider can't afford the baby's shoes That's the cycle so many of us go through America's black holocaust continues And I just hope we wake up soon before we fold I miss the days of old   Damn I miss the days of old Listen It ain't the same as the days of old",en,"([0.24080566, 0.00807823, 0.010513566, 0.050184447, 0.032255255], [0.53861, 0.08514833, 0.17080887, 0.41675487, 0.30203187], [0.22058436, 0.9067734, 0.81867754, 0.53306067, 0.66571283])",0.06836743652820587,0.30267077684402466,0.6289617419242859
