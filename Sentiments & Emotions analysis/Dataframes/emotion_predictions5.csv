1ecIqo8pOc8S6y3l80iGxd,Fancy,Reba McEntire,102.0,contemporary country," I remember it all very well looking back It was the summer I turned eighteen We lived in a one-room, rundown shack On the outskirts of New Orleans We didn't have money for food or rent To say the least, we were hard pressed Then mama spent every last penny we had To buy me a dancing dress Well, Mama washed and combed and curled my hair Then she painted my eyes and lips (Lips) Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress That had a split on the side clean up to my hip It was red velvet trim and it had fit me good Well, standing back from the looking glass There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood  She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"" She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""  Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck Then she kissed my cheek And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes As she started to speak She looked at our pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick And the baby's gonna starve to death"" She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said ""To thine own self be true"" And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high-heeled shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talking Asking Mama, ""What do I do?"" She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy They'll be nice to you""   She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down now Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""  Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been back But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out It wasn't very long until I knew exactly What my Mama'd been talking about I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow That I was gonna be a lady someday Though I didn't know when or how But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame You know I might've been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name  She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"" She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""   It wasn't long after a benevolent man Took me in off the streets And one week later I was pouring his tea In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was) I charmed a king, congressman And an occasional aristocrat Then I got me a Georgia mansion And an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)  Now in this world There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had But though I ain't had to worry about nothing For nigh on fifteen years Well, I can still hear the desperation In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears  ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down, hon' Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"" Oh, and I guess she did",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.007013900671154261}, {'label':

1MxAxn1jme5dT4ByQq8LLi,Antagonistic Radio,K-Rino,170.0,dirty south rap," Thanks for tuning in to Antagonistic Radio Tonight's guest is underground rapper: K-Rino We'll be covering a few topics heavily Like politics, religion and  his new album 'Therapy' Welcome to the show K, how are you this Saturday? I'm good.  Thanks for being here tonight.  Thanks for having me We'll, I'm not real familiar with your music, actually Enlighten our listeners on who you are . Gladly, G Well I started writing lyrics back in '83 Doing it as a hobby, long before it started paying me The neighbourhood where we hang, we rapped and let the beats bang] And what is 'SPC', is that some kind of street gang Nah man, we ain't no gang, we just a rap group So if I got loud and pushed you . I'd probably slap you So you condone violence . Depends on the scenario Mainly self-defence, disrespect, that's anywhere you go But on the cool, why are you asking silly questions dude? I'm just tryna get an understanding . But your questions are rude I know that alcohol and drugs rappers use a lot How many times have you been shot?  What?  How many tattoos you got? Neither one, all that stuff is a stereotype False media hype made for tricking and scaring your wife You say it's 'hype' but I have to disagree with ya How come you rappers always blame your image on the media? Well the things that they let people know go much deeper, bro They only show the bad side with the motive to deceive the whole Lies and propaganda feed the soul and folks believe what's told But how many TV and radio networks do we control? Now, you blame the corporate powers, wow that's seems absurd  Let me apologize to listeners hearing these lies I get it, you must be one of those conspiracy guys  Haha Who think the government's the reason streets are filled with crack They plotted war to steal Iraq  and police wanna kill the blacks That was good, you made my job easy that was real exact But everything you trying to joke about can be revealed with facts A million stats, yeah, the system's still running scams While we sit a home watching Maury and Bill Cunningham I represent the media, allow me to respond Man, you host a little radio show, you just a peon A feeder fish in a large pond tryna copy them Wishing you could be on CNN with O'Reilly and them So what about the black-on-black crime and disunity The sex and drugs you rappers like to glorify musically  That's what you say but you got some dirty songs of your own Yeah I made a lot of bad songs back in the day Now I watch what I say because it ain't wise me rapping that way But while you thinking you revealing something major You looking like a fool, my fans know my whole history, player I've seen and done it all, the good, bad, the ugly So I rap about my flaws to help others, that's why they love me] Well, I hear you okay, but on another note You seem to be dissatisfied with government, do you vote?  Can we talk about racism?  Your lyrics spew a lot of Nation of Islam doctrine  Do you endorse Minister Farrakhan?  There you go, blaming whitey for the Negro situation When you spend your whole lives on welfare and probation Won't you go to college and get a real education  Blah, blah, well back to the music  Hey let's go to the phone lines and take a few callers Caller, you're on the air  K, what's going on, man?

Hit the stop; eject button Cause I ain't shutting up for no one, not a single soul Remember me, the loco cholo going solo Well I'm back with a new rap, shows and fuck that All we can do is dance around a motherfucking hat But you are dead wrong, those days are long gone 'Cause my people are coming up and we're coming up strong And if you don't believe me fool, well that's on you But don't come crying saying I didn't warn you Cause it's dead on your face, the power of my race Expressed through the microphone as Ernie G drops bass Critics in the place might disgrace and say my song is rough But I say we've been kept down long enough So if I see you bitter, consider the situation son Maybe the blind could visualize where I'm coming from Cause I'm not getting dumb or getting educated lessons Of the underrated (power!) that my people are possessing And plus Chicanos stood proud since Ave. street Although it wasn't brought up in your class of history So listen to me cause now it's my hour And the lesson I'm kicking is called Mexican Power   And I'm very proud of that Mexican Power! And I'm very proud of that  So due to your blue eyed teacher, I got to tell you And shed some light on my race where he failed to So I'm gonna kick it to you and you must learn But it's a Mexican thing and it's Frank V.'s turn To pick up the mic and try to unite my people Hermanos y Hermanas damn straight we're equal What, you don't think so, think what you want to think But sleep with your eyes open, watch your back, and don't blink Cause I'll sneak attack you and jack you Everything you said about us, I'll say it back to you And more of it when the push comes to shoving Wouldn't be a pretty sight... But I'm not starting a fight, you know I rather unite With the ones around us who respect the brown Well fuck all the other motherfuckers who try to down us Or who think they can clown us But I'll just frown and instead I won't cry singing Tears of a Clown Cause I ain't staying down for another day Cause me and my people ain't going out that way I rather stand up tall and proud and never coward But I'm not superman, it's called Mexican Power   And I'm very proud of that It's called Mexican Power And I'm very proud of that Mexican Power watching the facility Yeah Mexican Power watching the facility Yeah  So if you're chrome bum or a rich man Beware of the power and don't you ever try to raise a hand Or a fist to diss this Hispanic Cuz just like a bandit, I'll leave you empty handed And all you get return for that antic Is proof that Mexican Power is la gang So here is this hispanic, fear the brown planet And if you can't stand it Don't ever take my rhyme for granted Cause I'll reprogram it and go spanish The rest of the public, they won't understand this Then they'll try to blame this single So I just stick to bilingual cause I am the bilingual That's doing this to mi carnalas and carnales Watching my back is DJ Ernie Gonzalez So if you want to be on this, I'll say ponle Que Viva la Raza, I'll shake your hand and say oralé Cause if you're down for your race, then your down with me And that right there holmes is how it should be I know it could be better but it could be worse Pride is the first step, first things first Cause once we possess our calles on where we stand We'll talk about unity among other Mexicans But that's down the line, I know it's gonna take time And if it ain't now, well next rythme And there'll be another rhyme with no doubt Cause I'm here to uplift, not to show out or go out But blow out the brains of the lames and check the minds Of those insinuating being brown is a crime And if that's true, I guess I'm a criminal Cause I'm brown to the maximum, never the minimal So remember whenever I pick up a pen Don't underestimate the power of a Mexican Mexican Power!

She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy They'll be nice to you""   She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down now Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""  Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been back But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out It wasn't very long until I knew exactly What my Mama'd been talking about I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow That I was gonna be a lady someday Though I didn't know when or how But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame You know I might've been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name  She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"" She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""   It wasn't long after a benevolent man Took me in off the streets And one week later I was pouring his tea In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was) I charmed a king, congressman And an occasional aristocrat Then I got me a Georgia mansion And an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)  Now in this world There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had But though I ain't had to worry about nothing For nigh on fifteen years Well, I can still hear the desperation In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears  ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down, hon' Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"" Oh, and I guess she did",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.007013900671154261}, {'label':

Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died  And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I
