I'm good.  Thanks for being here tonight.  Thanks for having me We'll, I'm not real familiar with your music, actually Enlighten our listeners on who you are . Gladly, G Well I started writing lyrics back in '83 Doing it as a hobby, long before it started paying me The neighbourhood where we hang, we rapped and let the beats bang] And what is 'SPC', is that some kind of street gang Nah man, we ain't no gang, we just a rap group So if I got loud and pushed you . I'd probably slap you So you condone violence . Depends on the scenario Mainly self-defence, disrespect, that's anywhere you go But on the cool, why are you asking silly questions dude? I'm just tryna get an understanding . But your questions are rude I know that alcohol and drugs rappers use a lot How many times have you been shot?  What?  How many tattoos you got? Neither one, all that stuff is a stereotype False media hype made for tricking and scaring your wife You say it's 'hype' but I have to disagree with ya How come you rappers always blame your image on the media? Well the things that they let people know go much deeper, bro They only show the bad side with the motive to deceive the whole Lies and propaganda feed the soul and folks believe what's told But how many TV and radio networks do we control? Now, you blame the corporate powers, wow that's seems absurd  Let me apologize to listeners hearing these lies I get it, you must be one of those conspiracy guys  Haha Who think the government's the reason streets are filled with crack They plotted war to steal Iraq  and police wanna kill the blacks That was good, you made my job easy that was real exact But everything you trying to joke about can be revealed with facts A million stats, yeah, the system's still running scams While we sit a home watching Maury and Bill Cunningham I represent the media, allow me to respond Man, you host a little radio show, you just a peon A feeder fish in a large pond tryna copy them Wishing you could be on CNN with O'Reilly and them So what about the black-on-black crime and disunity The sex and drugs you rappers like to glorify musically  That's what you say but you got some dirty songs of your own Yeah I made a lot of bad songs back in the day Now I watch what I say because it ain't wise me rapping that way But while you thinking you revealing something major You looking like a fool, my fans know my whole history, player I've seen and done it all, the good, bad, the ugly So I rap about my flaws to help others, that's why they love me] Well, I hear you okay, but on another note You seem to be dissatisfied with government, do you vote?  Can we talk about racism?  Your lyrics spew a lot of Nation of Islam doctrine  Do you endorse Minister Farrakhan?  There you go, blaming whitey for the Negro situation When you spend your whole lives on welfare and probation Won't you go to college and get a real education  Blah, blah, well back to the music  Hey let's go to the phone lines and take a few callers Caller, you're on the air  K, what's going on, man?   I just wanna say I appreciate what you saying   The host is a snake, though, he outta line Keep on checking that fool  Woop, it looks like we're outta time But one more question, one more thing You seem to have a negative view of the mainstream I just wanna know what started it, let's get to the heart of it I think that you're upset because you wish you were apart of it  So you're saying if it came down to it A million dollars for a beer commercial?  Oh my goodness  Guilty of what, giving you thugs a deal? Making us glorify that nonsense instead of what's real Feeding trash to the world] Which ones are you talking about?
