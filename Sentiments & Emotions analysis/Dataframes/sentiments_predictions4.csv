2v18sEJQj1FUOvGwojoIGf,The Days Of Old,Paris,61.0,gangster rap, Reminiscin' back when I was only a child Back in the days of livin' carefree lifestyles As long as we wasn't caught bein' bad was cool And we were never at a loss for something to get into Children in the neighbourhood down at the park Sunny days when we played at the old schoolyard Where kickin' it live was a familiar scene Kenny M. and Big Gene know what I mean But nowadays it seems life just ain't the same Everybody's involved in the game or a gang And when we die it seem like nobody cares It ain't no love in they cold-hearted stares Thinkin' of payback or makin' a hit Now Cowboys and Indians become real-life shit And life means nothin' when the heart is cold It ain't the same as the days of old  Yeah It ain't the same as the days of old  It's a unity thing much love for my people here But what good is love if the people don't really care? The triggers are cold at the O.K. Corral But it ain't okay when my people live foul Another sad case of the black-on-black It's a fact some of our people don't know how to act Can't go to the club can't to the store Can't chill with your girl can't go to the show Can't do anything without some fool actin' up You start to believe that black folk are savage but Before you do allow me to say That in the old days we didn't act that way see Kings and Queens were the names of the righteous But the sons of slaves are insane and we might just Self-destruct and erupt without a chance to grow This ain't the days of old   Damn This ain't the days of old I don't know C'mon  There is no match for a united America a determined America an angry America... Our outrage against the ploy unites us brings us together behind this one plan of action an assault on every front (Better wake up)  So I say what will it take before we change up? Some more of us dead or more of us locked up? Or maybe even more of us will blame the white man Before we understand now the problem's not him What I'm tellin' ya is actual fact I'm ain't pro-human 'cause all humans ain't pro-Black Remember in your mind that there still exists A plan to bring down a black fist See the struggle is uphill life's at a standstill Jack popped Jill now he don't act real And every livin' moment got her singin' the blues Her sole provider can't afford the baby's shoes That's the cycle so many of us go through America's black holocaust continues And I just hope we wake up soon before we fold I miss the days of old   Damn I miss the days of old Listen It ain't the same as the days of old,en,"([0.24080566, 0.00807823, 0.010513566, 0.050184447, 0.032255255], [0.53861, 0.08514833, 0.17080887, 0.41675487, 0.30203187], [0.22058436, 0.9067734, 0.81867754, 0.53306067, 0.66571283])",0.06836743652820587,0.30267077684402466,0.6289617419242859

She said: ""I was very amused"" I started throwin' bass she started throwin' back mid-range But when I sprung the question she acted kind of strange Then when I asked ""Do ya have a man?"" she tried to pretend She said: ""No I don't I only have a friend"" Come on!

They showed me where it was for the moment I didn't know I was in for such an event So I came to her room and opened the door Oh snap!  Guess what I saw?

I take a deep breath and then another follows 'Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow See  it's rough being a loner Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner See people got it bad from jump-street And being short is just another strike against me I used to get funny looks 'cause I was small And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall Given the odds I was up against bro The average nigga would've quit a long time ago But now I've got a record out I'm doing shows people paying to see me turn it out Now I'm the spice around town It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around I got friends and bitches on my dick But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe And every different day it's a different fuckin' ho And now that my pockets are getting bigger I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga They tell me that they love me and all that But really they just wait for me to fall flat So they can get me for my income Take me for all I got and then some Like Trina you dig?

If I make her shoot me Call me crazy but that's what I'm thinking I'm tripping from all that smoking weed and drinking But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own so I provoked her Punched her kicked her and chocked her She still wouldn't grab the gun And at that time I wasn't thinking about no one Damn near crazy I went and grabbed the baby (Bill! Gimme the baby! Gimme the baby!) Held him by the door and said I'ma throw his ass out ho She went to crying ""Somebody stop him"" I said ""You better grab the motherfuckin' gun or I'mma drop him"" She snatched the baby out of my hands We started fighting punching scratching and biting When we fell on the bed check this shit All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head So I ran and got the gun and came back to her Loaded it up and handed the gat to her I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle She screamed ""Stop"" and then we broke into another tussle Yo during the fight the gun went off quick Damn—Ah shit I'm hit   (Oh Lord! Oh Bill!) Ahh... my eye I can't see (Oh I'm so sorry!) Why you shot me in the eye? (Oh my God somebody help me!) I would've shot you in the body (Oh I'm sorry!) Why you shot me in the eye?

I wanna tell her I love her With an IV in my arm I took a picture for an album cover Goddamn this shit's a trip G Five different doctors with needles tryna stick me I hear my family hollering ""He needs us!"" During the confusion man I seen Jesus My mom's on the phone long-distance from New York Here comes the doctors again trying to rip me apart I got a monkey on my back I can't shake this I'm having suicidal thoughts hoping that I don't make it But I'ma make it 'cause something's steady urging me Five hours passed I made it through surgery And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night But God told me ""Everything is gonna be alright"" And I'm glad that I'm here G But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly   Heh oh man I made it I made it!
