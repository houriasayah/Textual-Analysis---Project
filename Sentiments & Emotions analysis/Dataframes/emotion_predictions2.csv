I'm not going away Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain And pops stayed the same and your moms moved away How many of our parents seem to make it anyway?

I'll be waiting at home"" Feels like we're learning this out on our own Trying to find a way down the road we don't know  Turn the lights down low Walk these halls alone We can feel so far from so close   Like ships in the night You keep passing me by We're just wasting time Trying to prove who's right And if it all goes crashing into the sea If it's just you and me Trying to find the light Like ships in the night You're passing me by You're passing me by Like ships in the night  And I'm gonna find my way Back to your side And I'm gonna find my way Back to your side  Like ships in the night You keep passing me by We're just wasting time Trying to prove who's right And if it all goes crashing into the sea If it's just you and me Trying to find the light Like ships in the night You're passing me by You're passing me by Like ships in the night",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0012884406605735421}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0006147533422335982}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0002444699639454484}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.9968345761299133}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0008656803402118385}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.000152140055433847}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9311322569847107}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005024248268455267}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0007052840664982796}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.025374118238687515}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.03707842156291008}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0006856917752884328}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9736331701278687}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.016138501465320587}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0005412258906289935}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.007192566059529781}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0020393691956996918}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00045508143375627697}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.048925645649433136}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.13902221620082855}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0026955059729516506}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.7733968496322632}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.03177573159337044}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004184024408459663}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.040986139327287674}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.636884868144989}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0067082978785037994}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.285550057888031}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.022864054888486862}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.007006565108895302}]]]","{'sadness': [0.0012884406605735421, 0.9311322569847107, 0.9736331701278687, 0.048925645649433136, 0.040986139327287674], 'joy': [0.0006147533422335982, 0.005024248268455267, 0.016138501465320587, 0.13902221620082855, 0.636884868144989], 'love': [0.0002444699639454484, 0.0007052840664982796, 0.0005412258906289935, 0.0026955059729516506, 0.0067082978785037994], 'anger': [0.9968345761299133, 0.025374118238687515, 0.007192566059529781, 0.7733968496322632, 0.285550057888031], 'fear': [0.0008656803402118385, 0.03707842156291008, 0.0020393691956996918, 0.03177573159337044, 0.022864054888486862], 'surprise': [0.000152140055433847, 0.0006856917752884328, 0.00045508143375627697, 0.004184024408459663, 0.007006565108895302]}",0.39919313054997474,0.1595369174843654,0.0021789567545056343,0.41766963358968495,0.01892465151613578,0.0024967005563667046

Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died  And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I

Ruining the play, to in the ensuing melee escape"" We packed up all of our bags The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks As we pace beneath flags black and battered Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord   We sail out on orders from him but we find The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines Where nothing we've actually seen has been mapped or outlined And we don't recognize the names upon these signs  And every night finds us rocking and rolling on waves wild and wide Well, we have lost our way, nobody's going to say it outright Just go la la la la la la la la la Oh, la la la la la la la la la la la Oh, oh, oh  La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.10689206421375275}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8265892267227173}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0026556102093309164}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.04908113554120064}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.013244434259831905}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0015374952927231789}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2923945188522339}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004577498883008957}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.001089701079763472}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.6939736604690552}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006946867797523737}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00101778085809201}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9935031533241272}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002734505571424961}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00039057779940776527}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0013549441937357187}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.001694008125923574}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0003228249552194029}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0101734334602952}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.07084067165851593}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00511070154607296}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.878350019454956}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.03229348361492157}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0032317431177943945}]]]","{'sadness': [0.10689206421375275, 0.2923945188522339, 0.9935031533241272, 0.0101734334602952], 'joy': [0.8265892267227173, 0.004577498883008957, 0.002734505571424961, 0.07084067165851593], 'love': [0.0026556102093309164, 0.001089701079763472, 0.00039057779940776527, 0.00511070154607296], 'anger': [0.04908113554120064, 0.6939736604690552, 0.0013549441937357187, 0.878350019454956], 'fear': [0.013244434259831905, 0.006946867797523737, 0.001694008125923574, 0.03229348361492157], 'surprise': [0.0015374952927231789, 0.00101778085809201, 0.0003228249552194029, 0.0032317431177943945]}",0.35074079246260226,0.22618547570891678,0.0023116476586437784,0.4056899399147369,0.013544698449550197,0.0015274610559572466

7EqHqILVR6yZE8hCSZodt0,Pure Comedy,Father John Misty,173.0,singer-songwriter," At six- For some reason when I go to the app...  The comedy of man starts like this: Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips And so nature, she devised this alternative: We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end Is kind enough to fill us in And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient So somebody's gotta go kill something while I look after the kids I'd do it myself, but what, are you gonna to get this thing its milk? He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy Just wait until the part where they start to believe They're at the center of everything And some all-powerful being Endowed this horror show with meaning   Oh, their religions are the best They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks These unbelievable outfits And they get terribly upset When you question their sacred texts Written by woman-hating epileptics Their languages just serve to confuse them Their confusion somehow makes them more sure They build fortunes poisoning their offspring And hand out prizes when someone patents a cure Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them? What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable? These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods So they can go on being godless animals   Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe Their horizons that just forever recede And how's this for irony: Their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs That they never ever have to leave Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!

With such a fire in our belly, such a hunger in our souls I guess I probably loved you when those words rolled off your tongue Seemed that we were traveling under some old lucky sun I know I couldn't save you and no one was to blame But the road we shared together once will never be the same  Hey gonna roll away Won't be coming round again Hey with a song, I pray And on the wings of a song I'll fly away  I wandered in the wilderness, for a while I was so lost To everything there is a season and every blessing has its cost So I took what you left to me, put it to some use Went looking for an answer with those  three chords  and the truth I come down from the mountain, I come walking in your shoes I was taken for a gambler when I had no more to lose For he put me on that pathway, how could I refuse? And I have spent my whole life out here working on the blues   So I carried on, you can't be haunted by the past People come, people go, and nothing ever lasts But I still think about you, wonder where you are Can you see me from some place up there among the stars? But down here under heaven, there never was a chart To guide our way across this crooked highway of the heart And if it's only all about the journey in the end On that road I'm glad I came to know you, my old friend  Hey gonna fly way Won't be coming round again Hey with a song, I pray And on the wings of a song I'll fly away  I'll fly away I'll fly away I love you",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0028059950564056635}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.030055800452828407}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.9654942750930786}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0007138350047171116}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0002905694127548486}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0006394237861968577}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5005871653556824}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.011159421876072884}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.001216252101585269}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.47347554564476013}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.012659034691751003}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0009026586194522679}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9962983727455139}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0006661726511083543}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00020755412697326392}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0011883261613547802}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0013917770702391863}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0002478579117450863}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.005180689971894026}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.08896482735872269}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.9024257063865662}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.002067053923383355}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0007235216326080263}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0006381768034771085}]]]","{'sadness': [0.0028059950564056635, 0.5005871653556824, 0.9962983727455139, 0.005180689971894026], 'joy': [0.030055800452828407, 0.011159421876072884, 0.0006661726511083543, 0.08896482735872269], 'love': [0.9654942750930786, 0.001216252101585269, 0.00020755412697326392, 0.9024257063865662], 'anger': [0.0007138350047171116, 0.47347554564476013, 0.0011883261613547802, 0.002067053923383355], 'fear': [0.0002905694127548486, 0.012659034691751003, 0.0013917770702391863, 0.0007235216326080263], 'surprise': [0.0006394237861968577, 0.0009026586194522679, 0.0002478579117450863, 0.0006381768034771085]}",0.376218055782374,0.03271155558468308,0.4673359469270508,0.11936119018355384,0.003766225701838266,0.0006070292802178301

I mean, do you really want to be Johnny's steady?"" Don't think that a woman could honestly believe that one month should be just about enough Well, first of all, let's see if dating that one boy Johnny a few times  Three important rules for breaking up Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to Prolonging the situation only makes it worse Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly Don't make a big production Don't make up an elaborate story This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene If you want to date other people say so Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected Even if you've gone together for only a short time And haven't been too serious There's still a feeling of rejection When someone says she prefers the company of others To your exclusive company But if you're honest, and direct And avoid making a flowery emotional speech When you break the news The boy will respect you for your frankness And honestly he'll appreciate the kind and Straightforward manner in which you told him your decision Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you'll remain friends   I'm head of the class I'm popular I'm a quarterback I'm popular My mom says I'm a catch I'm popular I'm never last picked I got a cheerleading chick  Being attractive is the most important thing there is If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond You have to be as attractive as possible Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean Wash it at least every two weeks Once every two weeks And if you see Johnny Football Hero in the hall Tell him he played a great game Tell him you liked his article in the newspaper  I'm the party star I'm popular I've got my own car I'm popular I'll never get caught I'm popular I make football bets I'm the teacher's pet   I propose we support a one month limit on going steady I think It would keep people more able to deal with weird situations And get to know more people I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit He won't mind, he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating And once you've dated someone else, you can date him again I'm sure he'll like it Everyone will appreciate it You're so novel, what a good idea You can keep your time to yourself You don't need date insurance You can go out with whoever you want to Every boy, every boy in the whole world could be yours If you'll just listen to my plan The teenage guide to popularity  I'm head of the class I'm popular I'm a quarterback I'm popular My mom says I'm a catch I'm popular I'm never last picked I got a cheerleading chick   I'm the party star I'm popular I've got my own car I'm popular I'll never get caught I'm popular I'm the teacher's pet I make football bets",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0012130074901506305}, {'label': 'joy', 'score':
