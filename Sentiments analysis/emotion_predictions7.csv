league with the foe Blame me for what's happening I can't try, I can't try, I can't try, I can't try No one knows the hard times I went through If happiness came I miss the call The stormy days ain't

(what you create) These niggas don't know how to act I should've been a school counselor To see what they'd get out of that All I wanna do is help, if it's a little Got up in this game to really try and make a change Wanna settle down, but this shit is so confusin' I'm just goin' through a stage where I'm learnin' how to be brave (keep your head up) Fuck a phase, this is life, all I need is me Look into my daughter's eyes and then I get the water eyes If I die, I pray to God she know her father tried, word (Word, Word)   Cause we just wanna live our lives Embraced faith, went against all odds In our eyes, to judge niggas, that is not our job To be a man, it is not that hard We gon' kill 'em with kindness When they try to take you out your comfort zone Ayo, it's time to be a man, understand We gon' kill 'em with kindness And you know you gotta fuckin' hold your own Can't let them take us away from the fam' We gon' kill 'em with kindness  Now I'm thinkin' in reality (what you thinking) Actually, I was thinkin' 'bout stability I watched my single mother's feet hurt for years Just to barely pay the bills - I don't know, that shit's killin' me But I don't wanna live like that Mama, I don't wanna see you live like that I told my little brothers we can build a new life For the ones that gave us life, we can give that back I know we tend to hold grudges I can't control it, I'm unfolding the emotion that I'm holdin' Hope the way I saw it ain't the way I won't approach it I'm just focused on the better me, this rap shit is my pedigree  (its all i got) Lately I've been feelin' life testin' me She say she down, and she say she wanna ride Release the need to please or be validated by eyes In disguise, I'm just focused on what makes me come alive (what makes me come alive) I've learned not to take nothin' personal Bad environments have been my disadvantage Not tryna be accepted, it stepped me out of my box And now these niggas watch me like I got all of the answers (got all of the answers) But this is what I've built for myself Realistic, always had to keep it real with myself So when they talk, and it's negative or it's false We channel out the negative thoughts without any help   Cause we just wanna live our lives Embraced faith, went against all odds In our eyes, to judge niggas, that is not our job To be a man, it is not that hard We gon' kill 'em with kindness When they try to take you out your comfort zone Ayo, it's time to be a man, understand We gon' kill 'em with kindness And you know you gotta fuckin' hold your own Can't let them take us away from the fam' We gon' kill 'em with kindness",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0007030019769445062}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9981735944747925}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0003980140609201044}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0003715528582688421}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.000198623733012937}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00015515845734626055}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.02423509769141674}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.6437721848487854}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003929056227207184}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.3201073706150055}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006312400568276644}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0016438928432762623}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.012382468208670616}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.642981231212616}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.3331049978733063}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.009354920126497746}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0014517669333145022}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0007246785680763423}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9853746891021729}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0005962267168797553}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0004667181638069451}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.012766040861606598}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0005914585199207067}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00020481363753788173}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.00807146541774273}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9623595476150513}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0018348516896367073}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.024848222732543945}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0017033746698871255}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0011824361281469464}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0007998363580554724}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9954286813735962}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.002850795164704323}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.000589169270824641}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.00020636600675061345}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0001252451620530337}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.003965592011809349}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.01428996305912733}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.9648587107658386}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.014732682146131992}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0008310097036883235}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0013219956308603287}]]]","{'sadness': [0.0007030019769445062, 0.02423509769141674, 0.012382468208670616, 0.9853746891021729, 0.00807146541774273, 0.0007998363580554724, 0.003965592011809349], 'joy': [0.9981735944747925, 0.6437721848487854, 0.642981231212616, 0.0005962267168797553, 0.9623595476150513, 0.9954286813735962, 0.01428996305912733], 'love': [0.0003980140609201044, 0.003929056227207184, 0.3331049978733063, 0.0004667181638069451, 0.0018348516896367073, 0.002850795164704323, 0.9648587107658386], 'anger': [0.0003715528582688421, 0.3201073706150055, 0.009354920126497746, 0.012766040861606598, 0.024848222732543945, 0.000589169270824641, 0.014732682146131992], 'fear': [0.000198623733012937, 0.006312400568276644, 0.0014517669333145022, 0.0005914585199207067, 0.0017033746698871255, 0.00020636600675061345, 0.0008310097036883235], 'surprise': [0.00015515845734626055, 0.0016438928432762623, 0.0007246785680763423, 0.00020481363753788173, 0.0011824361281469464, 0.0001252451620530337, 0.0013219956308603287]}",0.1479331643952589,0.6082287756144069,0.18677759199220287,0.054681422658697035,0.001613571447835836,0.0007654600610424365

pearls and diamonds But I've seen dark things come from shining So many nights I spent on my feet where I don't feel sleep It's not that we're afraid of what we can be, but what we will be I need somebody's loving hands to reach out and heal me I watch childhood movies to smile or remind me I'm still me Cause I'm fucked up in the real world So thankful that I have a son and not a lil' girl Because I don't call home every night I hear his voice and I breakdown and cry I see the pictures of him growin' and I hide Because I'm on a different road every night And I'm doing different shows every night But it beats selling dope every night  Standing in-front of crowds who might love it or hate it Sacrificing time with my son to perform in-front of possible racists, tasteless crowds where I give it my all And keep searching 'til love is found Make them put their hands up, jump around, and then touch the ground  The lights dance around in my mind 'til I can't sleep at night Then I hide in the dark in the day 'til I can't see that light But I feel them shadows pulling me They tugging on my soul And I feel them lights burning me They burning 'til it's cold But I feel them shadows pulling me They tugging on my soul -oul -oul -oul oul And I feel them lights burning me They telling me to go, go  Tryna find heaven, I've raised hell up But life is like photography, you need the negatives to develop So I step back, remind myself and cherish every moment The highs feel that much higher, when the lows are the lowest And we need those sweet moments to remind us to keep going Staring down the barrel of a gun isn't the opportune time to blow it But sometimes we need those moments, sometimes we need those moments Like God reminding us how small we are in the middle of the ocean When the waves come crashing, they show you how weak your human control is You can put a coat on, but you can't stop it rainin' and snowin', but we try Oh Lord knows we try No matter how many surgeries we have, you still going to die when it's time   The lights dance around in my mind 'til I can't sleep at night Then I hide in the dark in the day 'til I can't see that light But I feel them shadows pulling me They tugging on my soul And I feel them lights burnin' me They burning 'til it's cold But I feel them shadows pulling me They tugging on my soul -oul -oul -oul oul And I feel them lights burning me They telling me to go, oh",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0027034361846745014}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0014829367864876986}, {'label': 'love', 'score':
