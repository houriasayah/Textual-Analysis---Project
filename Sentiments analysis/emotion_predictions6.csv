a cab from west to east and men did wrong I walked and slipped and slide across the ice and feel the trees then I bumped into a girl I knew, wearing black and singing songs We both knew were about me

we'd move on and we'd take on the Bowery Many close collisions, we got a cab We drove into the darkness, New York City in the distance I bet ghosts had started peeling back the layers OK I want to be

Your future pulses in a computer I am you - now how'd that suit ya? Inherited chaos now instilled as I willed And now I just wait for the kill as they're born into the age of panic",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.38327381014823914}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.04724825546145439}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.011571780778467655}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.5477771162986755}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.00827960018068552}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0018494054675102234}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.01699676923453808}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.021960020065307617}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0010985936969518661}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.9547475576400757}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0046187774278223515}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0005782264051958919}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.001915753586217761}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.001067986129783094}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0002759074850473553}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.03114057146012783}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.9642096161842346}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0013902443461120129}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2925603985786438}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.023405376821756363}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0026110783219337463}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.01384746003895998}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.281086266040802}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.3864893913269043}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.4181287884712219}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.455556184053421}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.004600487183779478}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.10171379894018173}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.016642659902572632}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0033581105526536703}]]]","{'sadness': [0.38327381014823914, 0.01699676923453808, 0.001915753586217761, 0.2925603985786438, 0.4181287884712219], 'joy': [0.04724825546145439, 0.021960020065307617, 0.001067986129783094, 0.023405376821756363, 0.455556184053421], 'love': [0.011571780778467655, 0.0010985936969518661, 0.0002759074850473553, 0.0026110783219337463, 0.004600487183779478], 'anger': [0.5477771162986755, 0.9547475576400757, 0.03114057146012783, 0.01384746003895998, 0.10171379894018173], 'fear': [0.00827960018068552, 0.0046187774278223515, 0.9642096161842346, 0.281086266040802, 0.016642659902572632], 'surprise': [0.0018494054675102234, 0.0005782264051958919, 0.0013902443461120129, 0.3864893913269043, 0.0033581105526536703]}",0.22257510400377215,0.1098475645063445,0.00403156949323602,0.32984530087560415,0.2549673839472234,0.07873307561967521

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face I wanna get better, better, better, better I wanna get better I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change I wanna get better, better, better, better I wanna get better   I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was Now I'm a stranger And I miss the days of a life still permanent Mourn the years before I got carried away  So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself ""Hey, I wanna get better!""  I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face I wanna get better, better, better, better I wanna get better I didn't know I was broken 'til i wanted to change I wanna get better, better, better, better I wanna get better  'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi I'm screaming from my bedroom window Even if it's gonna kill me  Woke up this morning early before my family From this dream where she was trying to show me How a life can move from the darkness She said to get better So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away   That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself ""Hey, I wanna get better!""

Lone pine hill I signed up back in '61 I'm an army of Virginia man I've been from Mannasas to Mackonackey All the way to  Sailors Creek  fighting For my home land After 4 years gone and all hope lost And Richmond under seige And we're diggin out Five Forks And waitin in the rain For Sheridan to bring us to our knees So take me home... Lone pine hill There's a strange moon hangin' overhead tonight And if the rain keeps comin then the creek's gonna rise With the good lord's grace I'll make it outta this place and I'll be in your arms come the morning light I swear... So god grant me speed and grant me forgiveness And carry me on through the night Take me through your hills and over your rivers Away from this awful fight Cause I ain't never known a man that's ever owned another Ain't never owned nothin' of my own And after 4 long years I just can't tell you What the hell I've been fighting for...
