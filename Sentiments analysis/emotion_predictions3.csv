I mean, do you really want to be Johnny's steady?"" Don't think that a woman could honestly believe that one month should be just about enough Well, first of all, let's see if dating that one boy Johnny a few times  Three important rules for breaking up Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to Prolonging the situation only makes it worse Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly Don't make a big production Don't make up an elaborate story This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene If you want to date other people say so Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected Even if you've gone together for only a short time And haven't been too serious There's still a feeling of rejection When someone says she prefers the company of others To your exclusive company But if you're honest, and direct And avoid making a flowery emotional speech When you break the news The boy will respect you for your frankness And honestly he'll appreciate the kind and Straightforward manner in which you told him your decision Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you'll remain friends   I'm head of the class I'm popular I'm a quarterback I'm popular My mom says I'm a catch I'm popular I'm never last picked I got a cheerleading chick

popular I've got my own car I'm popular I'll never get caught I'm popular I make football bets I'm the teacher's pet   I propose we support a one month limit on going steady I think It would keep people more able to deal with weird situations And get to know more people I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit He won't mind, he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating And once you've dated someone else, you can date him again I'm sure he'll like it Everyone will appreciate it You're so novel, what a good idea You can keep your

Ruining the play, to in the ensuing melee escape"" We packed up all of our bags The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks As we pace beneath flags black and battered Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord   We sail out on orders from him but we find The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines Where nothing we've actually seen has been mapped or outlined And we don't recognize the names upon these signs  And every night finds us rocking and rolling on waves wild and wide Well, we have lost our way, nobody's going to say it outright Just go la la la la la la la la la Oh, la la la la la la la la la la la Oh, oh, oh  La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.10689206421375275}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8265892267227173}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0026556102093309164}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.04908113554120064}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.013244434259831905}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0015374952927231789}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2923945188522339}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004577498883008957}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.001089701079763472}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.6939736604690552}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006946867797523737}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00101778085809201}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9935031533241272}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002734505571424961}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00039057779940776527}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0013549441937357187}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.001694008125923574}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0003228249552194029}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0101734334602952}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.07084067165851593}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00511070154607296}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.878350019454956}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.03229348361492157}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0032317431177943945}]]]","{'sadness': [0.10689206421375275, 0.2923945188522339, 0.9935031533241272, 0.0101734334602952], 'joy': [0.8265892267227173, 0.004577498883008957, 0.002734505571424961, 0.07084067165851593], 'love': [0.0026556102093309164, 0.001089701079763472, 0.00039057779940776527, 0.00511070154607296], 'anger': [0.04908113554120064, 0.6939736604690552, 0.0013549441937357187, 0.878350019454956], 'fear': [0.013244434259831905, 0.006946867797523737, 0.001694008125923574, 0.03229348361492157], 'surprise': [0.0015374952927231789, 0.00101778085809201, 0.0003228249552194029, 0.0032317431177943945]}",0.35074079246260226,0.22618547570891678,0.0023116476586437784,0.4056899399147369,0.013544698449550197,0.0015274610559572466

I feel like I could forget about it I feel like I could mellow out I don't feel undone in a big way There's nothing really bad to be upset about  But when I thought I was getting better I woke up on the ground An appointment or a disappointment A setback, oh, another comedown  As if I needed a reminder Oh, I do only what I wanna So, I go through with this  Walking out in the nighttime springtime Needling my way home I saw Leah on the bus a few months ago I saw some old friends at her funeral My steps keep splitting my grief Through these solipsistic moods I should call my parents when I think of them Should tell my friends when I love them   Maybe I should have gone out a bit more When you guys were still in town I got too caught up in my own shit That's how every outcome's such a comedown  And I knew it when I saw it Oh, I did just what I wanted So, I go through with this I knew happiness when I saw it (And I saw it)",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0573619082570076}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0021989152301102877}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0008883497212082148}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.024329915642738342}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.9135810136795044}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0016397845465689898}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.003399662673473358}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9941867589950562}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0005653910920955241}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0010668736649677157}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0003121232148259878}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0004690330824814737}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.6431859731674194}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0813053548336029}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.004426049068570137}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.2565583884716034}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.013446076773107052}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0010781476739794016}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.006644819397479296}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9749905467033386}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.004027787130326033}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.011820973828434944}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0014142126310616732}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0011015863856300712}]]]","{'sadness': [0.0573619082570076, 0.003399662673473358, 0.6431859731674194, 0.006644819397479296], 'joy': [0.0021989152301102877, 0.9941867589950562, 0.0813053548336029, 0.9749905467033386], 'love': [0.0008883497212082148, 0.0005653910920955241, 0.004426049068570137, 0.004027787130326033], 'anger': [0.024329915642738342, 0.0010668736649677157, 0.2565583884716034, 0.011820973828434944], 'fear': [0.9135810136795044, 0.0003121232148259878, 0.013446076773107052, 0.0014142126310616732], 'surprise': [0.0016397845465689898, 0.0004690330824814737, 0.0010781476739794016, 0.0011015863856300712]}",0.17764809087384492,0.513170393940527,0.002476894253049977,0.0734440379019361,0.23218835657462478,0.001072137922164984

When you reached for your plume of smoke It'll haunt you, my honey bee Anyone who is anyone has that same dream Were you falling Were you flying And were you calling out Or were you dying Thank god you're up now Let's stay this way Else there'll be no mornings And no more days 'cause when we're dreaming The babies grow The sun shines And the shadows flow Time flies The phone rings There is a silence When everybody tries to sing",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.4791494309902191}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.00356996338814497}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0009786331793293357}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.5126600861549377}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.003009088570252061}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0006328514427877963}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.1366431713104248}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.6845809817314148}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003924654796719551}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.1640980839729309}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.00889517366886139}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0018579746829345822}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9880180358886719}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005148870404809713}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00042704216320998967}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.005539081525057554}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0005284781218506396}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0003384397132322192}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.04382387921214104}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0014196685515344143}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0005516789969988167}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.006346024572849274}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.9391655325889587}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.008693191222846508}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.19777022302150726}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.5457767248153687}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.008933323435485363}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.016958191990852356}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.22549764811992645}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.005063814111053944}]]]","{'sadness': [0.4791494309902191, 0.1366431713104248, 0.9880180358886719, 0.04382387921214104, 0.19777022302150726], 'joy': [0.00356996338814497, 0.6845809817314148, 0.005148870404809713, 0.0014196685515344143, 0.5457767248153687], 'love': [0.0009786331793293357, 0.003924654796719551, 0.00042704216320998967, 0.0005516789969988167, 0.008933323435485363], 'anger': [0.5126600861549377, 0.1640980839729309, 0.005539081525057554, 0.006346024572849274, 0.016958191990852356], 'fear': [0.003009088570252061, 0.00889517366886139, 0.0005284781218506396, 0.9391655325889587, 0.22549764811992645], 'surprise': [0.0006328514427877963, 0.0018579746829345822, 0.0003384397132322192, 0.008693191222846508, 0.005063814111053944]}",0.3690809480845928,0.24809924177825451,0.0029630665143486113,0.14112029364332557,0.23541918421396985,0.0033172542345710097
