2v18sEJQj1FUOvGwojoIGf,The Days Of Old,Paris,61.0,gangster rap," Reminiscin' back when I was only a child Back in the days of livin' carefree lifestyles As long as we wasn't caught, bein' bad was cool And we were never at a loss for something to get into Children in the neighbourhood, down at the park Sunny days when we played at the old schoolyard Where kickin' it live was a familiar scene Kenny M. and Big Gene know what I mean But nowadays, it seems life just ain't the same Everybody's involved in the game or a gang And when we die, it seem like nobody cares It ain't no love in they cold-hearted stares Thinkin' of payback or makin' a hit Now Cowboys and Indians become real-life shit And life means nothin' when the heart is cold It ain't the same as the days of old  Yeah It ain't the same as the days of old  It's a unity thing, much love for my people here But what good is love if the people don't really care? The triggers are cold at the O.K. Corral But it ain't okay when my people live foul Another sad case of the black-on-black It's a fact, some of our people don't know how to act Can't go to the club, can't to the store Can't chill with your girl, can't go to the show Can't do anything without some fool actin' up You start to believe that black folk are savage but Before you do, allow me to say That in the old days we didn't act that way, see Kings and Queens were the names of the righteous But the sons of slaves are insane and we might just Self-destruct and erupt without a chance to grow This ain't the days of old   Damn This ain't the days of old I don't know C'mon  There is no match for a united America, a determined America, an angry America... Our outrage against the ploy unites us, brings us together behind this one plan of action, an assault on every front (Better wake up)  So I say, what will it take before we change up? Some more of us dead, or more of us locked up? Or maybe even more of us will blame the white man Before we understand now the problem's not him What I'm tellin' ya is actual fact I'm ain't pro-human 'cause all humans ain't pro-Black Remember in your mind that there still exists A plan to bring down a black fist See the struggle is uphill, life's at a standstill Jack popped Jill, now he don't act real And every livin' moment got her singin' the blues Her sole provider can't afford the baby's shoes That's the cycle so many of us go through America's black holocaust continues And I just hope we wake up soon before we fold I miss the days of old   Damn I miss the days of old Listen It ain't the same as the days of old",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0004775050329044461}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9983183145523071}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0005539728445000947}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0003070348175242543}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.00014292189734987915}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00020033128384966403}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0006933860131539404}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.00039070367347449064}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0008200759184546769}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.997003972530365}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0008337856852449477}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0002581667504273355}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0007758720894344151}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0007271625800058246}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0008141366415657103}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.9964005947113037}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0008859418448992074}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00039624268538318574}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.770024836063385}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.018657593056559563}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0015674063470214605}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.20034781098365784}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.008277665823698044}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.001124745118431747}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.9662368893623352}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.02469548210501671}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0007663309224881232}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.005966985132545233}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0019116982584819198}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00042251372360624373}]]]","{'sadness': [0.0004775050329044461, 0.0006933860131539404, 0.0007758720894344151, 0.770024836063385, 0.9662368893623352], 'joy': [0.9983183145523071, 0.00039070367347449064, 0.0007271625800058246, 0.018657593056559563, 0.02469548210501671], 'love': [0.0005539728445000947, 0.0008200759184546769, 0.0008141366415657103, 0.0015674063470214605, 0.0007663309224881232], 'anger': [0.0003070348175242543, 0.997003972530365, 0.9964005947113037, 0.20034781098365784, 0.005966985132545233], 'fear': [0.00014292189734987915, 0.0008337856852449477, 0.0008859418448992074, 0.008277665823698044, 0.0019116982584819198], 'surprise': [0.00020033128384966403, 0.0002581667504273355, 0.00039624268538318574, 0.001124745118431747, 0.00042251372360624373]}",0.3476416977122426,0.20855785119347275,0.0009043845348060131,0.4400052796350792,0.0024104027019347996,0.0004803999123396352

Let me tell a story of my situation I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert She had long hair and a short miniskirt I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof"" I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah"" She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused"" I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend"" Come on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing  You, you got what I need But you say he's just a friend And you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend   So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime 'Cause I have friends and that's a fact Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack Forget about that, let's go into the story About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me So we started talkin', gettin' familiar Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a Relationship or some understanding How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin' Everything sounded so dandy and sweet I had no idea I was in for a treat After this was established, everything was cool The tour was over and she went back to school I called every day to see how she was doin' Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin' I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend"" Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!

She said, my name is Renee I said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway? She said if you want, so yo, we started talking I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking I had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat So we must chat about this and that She told me what she was in school for She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law I'm telling shorty I'm a writer And as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider Covers her mouth with her name ring I said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing But yet I use Philly blunts She said, ""I never dealt with Philly blunts Because I heard that's for silly stunts"" I said nah they burn slower Right now I really don't know ya But maybe later on, I can get to show you  A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty   So now we sitting on the train Besides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain Now understand she got flava A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her Got off the train about 6:34 She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store Went to the crib and turned the lights on A mad magazine stand From Essence to Right On A leather couch, stereo system with crazy CDs Understand, kid, she got G's She said Cheeks, do what you want She said I'm gonna feed the dog I said, alright well I'ma roll this blunt She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt A yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl We're sitting on the couch chatting We're smoking blunts off the balcony We're staring at Manhattan now She started feeling on my chest I started feeling on the breasts And there's no need for me to stress the rest A yo, I got myself a winner We sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner She had a tattoo she only wanted go to see But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that 'Cause on the real this is where it's at   A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty A ghetto love is the law that we live by Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday Give it up for my shorty  I woke up the next day on the waterbed A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said It said, ""Cheeks, I'll be home around two You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you"" I left my number for shorty to call me later Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator I got a beep around three I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me And now we been together for weeks Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks Hey man, I never been in love But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinking of I'm hanging out with my crew I get a beep from Renee  because Renee uses Code Two But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes She says ""Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's"" I jumps on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick Ay yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick Not even thinking about the po-nine I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck,   I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine I gotta see what's going on But by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me ""Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone"" I'm pouring beer out for my Shorty who ain't here I'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears   A ghetto love is the law

Gimme the baby! Gimme the baby!) Held him by the door and said I'ma throw his ass out, ho She went to crying, ""Somebody stop him"" I said, ""You better grab the motherfuckin' gun or I'mma drop him"" She snatched the baby out of my hands We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting When we fell on the bed, check this shit All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head So I ran and got the gun and came back to her Loaded it up and handed the gat to her I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle She screamed, ""Stop,"" and then we broke into another tussle Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick Damn—Ah shit, I'm hit   (Oh, Lord!
