of silver and gold Gave the children all tickets, then the story he told Of a time in the future that was sunshine and flowers And the children grew sleepy in the sky's white towers They dreamed of the story that the guard had displayed They saw all the wonders, tiny minds were amazed They saw candy forests and dragons that breathed fire On all that was evil in the misty mire  They came to the village where the turtles in caves Made pies for the people and the lemonade The people lived out by the sea and each day The seagulls would wake them as they passed on their way The people were kindly, they would sing to the sky And each bright new morning, the sun shone from their eyes The children passed over and all the people could see As they dived from the sky to the treacle sea They bathed on the white sand, minutes turned into hours And the children all giggled and gave each other flowers  The king from his castle came down to the sea And he spoke to the children so patiently He gave them small presents and bid them farewell And the children unwrapped them, tiny silver bells Their tinkling floated across the island with ease And it came back toward them on the perfume breeze They smiled at the tinkling, they gazed at the sun And they smiled at each other, pretty little ones A beautiful white horse came down to the sea And the children all climbed up as he knelt on one knee   They rode through the valleys and high over hills And they laughed oh so loudly, their fear to kill They came to a lakeside of deep velvet and green And they all stared in wonder at its beauty serene They climbed from the white horse, they watch as it goes As they stood by the green lake for to kiss their toes A boat in the distance was suddenly there Waiting to take the children to anywhere The porcupine captain said that he didn't mind In his coat of black needles, he looked very kind  His crew were six rabbits with fluffy white ears And the children all stroked them and lost all their fears They sailed through the sunshine, across the green lake And they drank lemonade and they ate ice-cream cake They landed in a dark cave as the boat disappeared And they all stood in darkness, through the shadows they peered But out of the blackness shone diamonds so bright Their tiny white hands shielded eyes from the light In a pool of quicksilver stood Neptune so wise And pearls were his white teeth, bright diamonds his eyes  He spoke to the children in a voice of velvet And he beckoned them to him, in a circle they sat He told of sky island and of his magic cave And magic pink seashells to the children he gave They listened intently as the music came far From the magic pink seashells and nobody talked But Neptune had vanished when they lifted their eyes So they walked from the cave as two kingfishers cried In the bright shiny sunlight, they got down on one knee They listened to the sea shells of the musical sea   But the day grew much darker, so they climbed on the breeze And they floated to the village, and the people were pleased To see them so happy with their tinkling bells And the people all listened to the musical shells But the children were so sad, the time had come to leave So the people waved goodbye and begged them to believe Of the wonders they had seen in the island of the sky And the children said they would and away they did fly Through the white clouds of no time 'til forever it seems And the children stayed children and they lived in their dreams",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0015955888666212559}, {'label': 'joy',

5nQA7F1fPa23sY8CPPA9Hr,Forever Autumn,Jeff Wayne,146.0,art rock," For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. But by the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone...  The summer sun is fading as the year grows old And darker days are drawing near The winter winds will be much colder Now you're not here  I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky And one by one they disappear I wish that I was flying with them Now you're not here  Like the sun through the trees you came to love me Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way You always loved this time of year Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now  Cause you're not here Cause you're not here Cause you're not here   Fire suddenly leapt from house to house, the population panicked and ran and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally I headed eastward for the ocean, and my only hope of survival: A boat out of England...  Like the sun through the trees you came to love me Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes As if to hide a lonely tear My life will be forever autumn  Cause you're not here Cause you're not here Cause you're not here  As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling and streaked with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulder with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horses' bits were covered with foam… and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest. We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper - Waterloo Bridge, Westminster Bridge… One appeared above Big Ben .  Ulla!  Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people, unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind… A vast crowd buffeted me toward the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board - straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie! At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank.

'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school But their lips met, and reservations started to pass Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last  Either way, he wanted her, and this was bad Wanted to do things to her, it was making him crazy Now a little crush turned into a like And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her  I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart As I whisper in your ear,   ""I wanna fucking tear you apart""   I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart As I whisper in your ear,   ""I wanna fucking tear you apart"" I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart As I whisper in your ear,   ""I wanna fucking tear you apart""",en,"[[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0021722200326621532}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9878385066986084}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0008338579791598022}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.006443506106734276}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0017981099663302302}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.000913890078663826}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0007871313719078898}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0020282550249248743}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.9950534701347351}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.00042320246575400233}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.000640320882666856}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0010675349039956927}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.008559958077967167}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.019833968952298164}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.016239386051893234}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.9249089360237122}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.02901442162692547}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0014432454481720924}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.001029220991767943}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0016557264607399702}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.9947750568389893}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0005139856948517263}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0008197069982998073}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0012064325856044888}]], [[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0008816804038360715}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0017021531239151955}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.9953872561454773}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0004187594458926469}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0006307344301603734}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0009794458746910095}]]]","{'sadness': [0.0021722200326621532, 0.0007871313719078898, 0.008559958077967167, 0.001029220991767943, 0.0008816804038360715], 'joy': [0.9878385066986084, 0.0020282550249248743, 0.019833968952298164, 0.0016557264607399702, 0.0017021531239151955], 'love': [0.0008338579791598022, 0.9950534701347351, 0.016239386051893234, 0.9947750568389893, 0.9953872561454773], 'anger': [0.006443506106734276, 0.00042320246575400233, 0.9249089360237122, 0.0005139856948517263, 0.0004187594458926469], 'fear': [0.0017981099663302302, 0.000640320882666856, 0.02901442162692547, 0.0008197069982998073, 0.0006307344301603734], 'surprise': [0.000913890078663826, 0.0010675349039956927, 0.0014432454481720924, 0.0012064325856044888, 0.0009794458746910095]}",0.002686042175628245,0.20261172205209732,0.6004578054300509,0.18654167794738896,0.006580658780876547,0.0011221097782254219
