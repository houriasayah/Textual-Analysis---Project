We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres If none of us own acres, and none of us grow wheat Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat? So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding 'Cause all we seem to give them is some ballin' and some dancin' And some talkin' about our car and imaginary mansions We should be indicted for bullshit we incitin' Sellin' children death and pretendin' it's excitin' We are advertisements for agony and pain We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine In the '80s when them bricks came on military planes  A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.

We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby Same as in Iraq and Afghanistan And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor If I say any more, they might be at my door (Shh) Who the fuck is that staring in my window?

And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died   I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died  We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""   Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?

the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died  And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I

Lone pine hill There's a strange moon hangin' overhead tonight And if the rain keeps comin then the creek's gonna rise With the good lord's grace I'll make it outta this place and I'll be in your arms come the morning light I swear... So god grant me speed and grant me forgiveness And carry me on through the night Take me through your hills and over your rivers Away from this awful fight Cause I ain't never known a man that's ever owned another Ain't never owned nothin' of my own And after 4 long years I just can't tell you What the hell I've been fighting for...

There is nothing in front of you Except this mess, that's sad but true We all saw it coming, but it was too late Too soon!  Industrial ghosts, forbidden zones Electric fence, restricted promise land Dead sky above, our lives without love Red moon guiding us back to primal dust There was a time when we still had time To make the big change So now, here's your change Your change    Deep down inside In the crust of mankind remains Magma finds its way out, explodes And rises in the sky, then falls like rain  In order to survive Do anything to save your soul Just keep your eyes on endless roads In hope we trust, in order to survive... In order to survive!  There is a place I know for sure Where there is life, and the water is pure But it's not mine, and it's not yours... But it's not mine, and it's not yours...
